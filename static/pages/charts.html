<p>This OrthoDB online tool allows the generation of a comparative overview of the gene content across selected genomes. The total gene counts and the fractions of orthologs among these species shows the level of relatedness among the genomes, highlighting the "universal" core of genes and the ones evolving under single-copy constraint [<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?cmd=Search&term=21148284" target="blank">PMID:21148284</a>].</p>
<p>You can select up to 20 species on the right panel to be included into the comparative genomics chart. The colors, patterns, etc can be customised from the "Configure chart" tab on the right panel. The fractions shown are hyperlinked to their corresponding Ortholog Groups from which the gene counts were made. The tailored chart can then be exported as a publication quality vector graphics.</p>
